# dotfiles (Ubuntu Linux)
My scripts, installers and config files for Ubuntu Linux. It's my setup on private computer.

For more details, check source code of the scripts and contents of the directories.

Common tools I use on Ubuntu are as follows:
- [zsh](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/zsh.html)
- [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)
