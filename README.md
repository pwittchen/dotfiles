dotfiles
========
my dotfiles used both on Arch Linux and macOS

git branches:

- `master` - here I keep my current setup for the macOS (currently active)
- `legacy-arch-linux-config` - here I keep my legacy Arch Linux config

**please note**: this is my personal setup and part of this stuff may not work out of the box and not all linked scripts and files are available in this repo what is done on purpose
